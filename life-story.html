      <h1 class="textcenter"> A non traditional start to a never ending journey...</h1>
      <h3 class="textcenter"> Preface </h3>
      <p> Writing a novel about yourself isn't easy, however I want to be as thorough as possible.
          This is generally a straight-forward and very blunt version of how I came to be where I
          am now. Note* This is fairly personal and one would question, "Why put something so personal
          out in the open?" I've debated such internally for quite a while, however I'd rather someone
          know me at a deeper level, to understand me as a person, to understand what I've been
          through and how I've utilized that to achieve my goals and push forward in this scary
          world we call home. Upfront and brutal honesty is something I tend to live by. </p>
      <hr class="style-five"> </hr>
      <h3 class="textcenter"> A beginning to an era...(Or something like that) </h3>
      <p> I was born on September 19th, 1994 in New Braunfels, Texas. Though I was only born there,
        I lived for most of my life (or at least my adolescent life) within a small town called Seguin.  </p>
      <p>  From there I didn't really have a computer of my own until around first grade, for which I used a computer at a local library.
        I still recall the nostalgia of being able to utilize it and play video games on it. How simple life was then.  </p>
      <hr class="style-five"></hr>
      <h3 class="textcenter"> A bird freed from it's cage: </h3>
      <p>As I grew up, computers were no longer a casual occurrence. I began to assimilate to a
         lifestyle that revolved around them. I wanted to know how they worked, operated and most
         of all -- how to create and develop these games that are so enticing. Eventually that
         love grew and I acquired a computer of my own, installed various operating systems,
         created silly batch files and overall had fun with it. From those seemingly minescule
         experiences I learned various programming aspects with the ability to automate processes
         (normally shutting computers down) and picking up both windows and linux administrative
         processes. I also dabbled with some web development during this time, or web development
         of an older generation. (I heard you liked tables inside of tables inside of tables.) </p>
      <hr class="style-five"></hr>
      <h3 class="textcenter"> Transcendence </h3>
      <p> From this point on, things hit a bit of a serious note. I was involved in various programs (robotics, Cyber Patriot, Business Professionals of America(BPA), etc) and
          used the various skills that I learned from them to venture out and work at various locations. My first tech oriented job was at a well known company called Rackspace,
          for which I worked on a web development team to assist and customize internal sites for the plethora of users at Rackspace. Through this internship I gained skills in
          Groovy, HTML, CSS, Jquery, Javascript, agile development and many more. I was also introduced to various frameworks, such as Angular, Nodejs and Meteor. This internship
          opened up my world to a vast amount of ideas and possibilities that I never truly grasped as a kid from a small town. </p>
      <p> I made it prominent to sharpen my skills, work on personal projects and assist with open source projects as a means to use my skills for a better future.
          I feel like I've undergone a metamorphosis in areas that I wouldn't have ventured into.
          In my previous job I was treated with the utmost respect and was able to apply my skills within the networking and web development world.
          I have felt validated that my skills were adequate enough to work within a professional environment and provide technical solutions to important companies.
          Through my journey in my previous job I've developed strong interpersonal skills that I feel most computer science majors struggle with. Being able to look someone in the eyes and obtain respect for skills
          that an individual has is very difficult and often one of the main issues that applicants face when first walking out into the professional world. In this job I was
          able to hone my networking skills (both personal and technical), learning advanced system configurations, networking with Cisco and Viata, using various tools for
          network monitoring(IDS, IPS, ntop, etherape, snort, etc), network structures (Maintaining an MDF, routing & switching, firewall maintenance) and some experience with
          automation tools (such as Salt, Ansible and Groovy). The tools that I've learned to use through this internship experience have opened my horizons and allowed me to
          expand my knowledge and grow. <p>
      <hr class="style-five"></hr>
      <h3 class="textcenter"> A Never Ending Journey: </h3>
      <p> I want to continue to learn and grow within the technology community. I want to acquire knowledge of cutting edge technology and in turn help individuals in situations
          where starting off is hard and experience is only gathered through the aid of others. My greatest aspiration is to hit a point in life where I've achieved enough that I am then
          able to pass down my knowledge to others. For in life, to have knowledge is powerful. But to have knowledge and use it to teach is the greatest power of all.
      </p>
