        <h3> The Curse of Mankind… </h3>
        <p> When a child becomes too stubborn or steps out of bounds, it is a mother’s right to scald or punish this child.
           As she brought this child into the world, so she should be able to take them out of it. This ideology has been
           imbedded within countless eras and as advancements grew, so did the people. Yet though these people no longer
           took physical shapes or physical presences, they still remained, still waged wars and were still unable to
           ease their boredom. This was a never ending cycle until one being, a being who had amassed enough power to
           destroy all of her brethren, made a decision. This being decided that for their greater good, it was her right
           to destroy her friends and family in order for peace to be brought down upon the world. Through these means, she
           ruthlessly tore down her fellow comrades, destroying their very being and eradicating them from existence.  Once
           all beings were dealt with and no traces remained, this war goddess rested. Licked her wounds and began to plan
           her new existence. She no longer had friends to talk to, someone to confide in, or anyone to bring her joy. She
           embodied the true meaning of being alone. For it was only her mind that kept her company for all these eons, yet
           soon she recovered.
        </p>
        <p> Upon her recovery she examined the world, it was devastated. The war she had recklessly waged had unfortunately
           destroyed much of once was her home. However, given that she had cast off the shackles of her previous humanity,
           she sought out to create a new civilization. This civilization would be perfect, she thought. It would be free from
           the treacherous power struggles and ruthless killing of her previous kin, as she was able to create a “perfect” society.
           This great being mustered up all of her energy, forcing herself to her limits and she reshaped the world into a beautiful
           utopia and laid the seeds for a new and enlightened mankind to be formed. However through this great feat, she had become
           again recklessly brought herself to her limits. So she slept, knowing that when she awoke, a new society will have formed.
           It would be thriving and it would be perfect.
        </p>
        <p> When she awakened, she leaped out into the air looking down upon her wonderful creations in an attempt to take in all of
           their progression at once and to assess their current state. However, these creatures were not the beautiful and divine manifestation
           she had sought to create. No, these creatures were even worse than her brethren once were. They were unrefined grovel that had no place
           in this world and she was sickened that all of her hard work had been put into such creatures. She had to work at once, had to rectify
           her mistake and start anew with a better and more beautiful slate of creatures. So again, this powerful war goddess prepared to massacre
           an entire population. These weak and unknowing citizens were soon to fall, for these creatures were filth and deserved no less than a
           salvage assault from this mother’s rage. She sent down a manifestation of chaos to do her bidding to ensure that no beings were left for
           her next project.
        </p>
        <p> Within an instant of this manifestation’s release, harsh rain struck down from above a great western continent. People began to scatter,
            fleeing from the sting of cold water, almost like acid. The streets began to fill and debris that once lay dormant was now carried in a
            torrent of waves, almost trembling in the wake of the water’s power. The little continent was being gutted alive as trees were uprooted
            from the ground and buildings were broken, being put on their knees as they let out a genocidal scream of creaks, almost begging to be
            saved from this monstrous entity. This western continent was decimated; however it was not the only thing to fall that day. Multiple
            major cities and rural environments were destroyed in the torrents and very few lives were spared.  But this was not the end of their
            torment. No, there would be much more.
        </p>
        <p> Off in the distant north, a continent began to quake, the fiber’s of its being was shaken down to the land’s core. Cracks slowly began
            to form, splitting buildings in two and causing smoke to rise. Blood curdling screams could be heard trailing off into the distance, sharing
            their last contribution to the world in the form of terror. Soon cracks began to overtake the continent, causing all of the structures to either
            fall or be lost into the depths of nothingness. Soon all that was heard was that of a slow but constant crackling. Red hot lava had been regurgitate
            from the land, spewing back the lost belongings and bodies that had just been swallowed, ensuring that their very essence suffered. All that
            remained of this continent and its suffering was an eerie cloud of ash that covered the entirety of the content, drifting up in plumes. However
            from a distance one could see the faint outlines of a skull that appeared to have a crack splitting down the center.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, the east was ravaged; however the populace was the most interesting. These people were religious, zealots and worshiped some unknown figure.
           Though this figure was not the supreme goddess, no it took the form of a patriarchal deity which showed it’d power through force. Such beings worshiping
           a fake and faulty god should be crushed. So torrents of waters were sent to play with these zealots, giving them the worst death of all. The east’s people
           did not flee, they did not cower, they were not afraid… at first. At first the waters began to swell, causing it to swirl and crash into their chapels,
           as if clawing at them and toying with its prey. Their faith held strong, for those brief moments. But then the contents of the water began to take on a
           soft red color that began to slowly become darker. “Repent!” yelled a priest unknowingly gazing into his peons; however his voice only fell on deaf ears.
           Everyone in this illustrious gilded chapel had realized what the ocean water had mixed with, blood. Its manifestation was both cruel and maniacal and as
           its pitch finally hit a solid blood red color, it began to seep through the walls. Slowly creeping in and covering the floors. The religious zealots that
           were once calm began to panic as their soft leather shoes were now drenched in a fowl, tainted blood. The blood of those that had fallen before them; the
           blood that would destroy them. The blood took hours to fill the chamber, however no matter how hard the peons tried to break down the glass or the doors to
           try to escape; only more blood flowed in. There was no escape from their pursuer. Not even their religious deity could save them now.
        </p>
        <p> One thing remained, but this entity was eternal. For it was the being that once gave life to such beautiful beings, but these beings had been tainted.
          Life forms now devoid of the beauty, devoid of purpose and devoid of a soul. This mother now sought to take back what had once been given, to return her
          children to her fiery depths in hopes that she could start anew. Maybe the next assortment of creatures will listen, for when her screams fill the air yet
          fall on deaf ears; rage begins to bellow from within. The fury unleashed cannot be stopped. However through the ashes of destruction life can be born anew.
          This newly formed life can be forged pure, purer than any refined metal so that their essence, their true soul, shall remain untainted. Or so this being
          hoped, yet creation through malice shall never create peace. Her want to start over by destroying her once beautiful creation was now tainted by her former
          destruction. So to ensure that her influence be purged from existence, she created her last creation, a world without complexity, a world without a purpose
          for as she forged this new world, she took her own life, assuming that her tainted wishes were the reason for all of mankind’s previous mistakes.
        </p>
        <p> The next society was different in a way. They formed as different races and populated different areas. They developed and expanded, soon finding each other
            and through war and trade, these countries grew. Interactions were rough; certain populations of people were treated poorly by those with greater resources
            or superior technology. However, a true insight was made. For mankind’s true curse is that mankind is inherently evil.</p>

        <h3>The time traveler, and the old wise man.</h3>
        <p> There once was a man named Cleion, and on his many journeys he happened upon a man.
           The man had no name, as it was lost in the ages of past, but he had many secrets to tell,
           though at a price. Cleion, still young and youthful, had no care for his body and his
           superiority complex brought him to think he was invincible. But as he continued to find
           through his many long journeys and awkward endeavors, he was not as strong, smart, or
           talented as he was first brought to believe.  His fights with Hercules left him scarred
           and battered, with Hercules still in his prime. He even attempted to go for the best of
           the underworld and fight Hatis, but even then, with one of the weaker gods, he was
           bested and again brought to the brink of his life. But he has this oddness about
           him, his sheer will to believe that he would never die, that kept him alive. No one
           knows why he was spared, and many feel he should be dead. But on he lives, until
           the meeting of this old man....</p>
        <p>Cleion walks up to a warried traveler, appearing to be in his late 90s and unable to
           move, sitting on a stone slab and peering out into the vast canyons that run through the
           land. Orange sand glistened as it seamlessly was lifted into the air and wove around into
           the sky. Cleion asks the old man his name, with his poorly obtained manners. "Dear sir,
           give me your name or face the invincible cleion, master of this realm and ruler of all
           lowly creatures. The old man looks at him, and a twinkle in his eyes sparks something in
           Cleion. :I am the wind, the sand, the ages. I have no true being, but am eternal. Do not
           question the name of my being, as the depths of time have all but erased it." Cleion
           looked at the old man puzzled, then said with an inquisitive voice. "But then what may
           i call you, and what can you offer me as service?" The old man chuckles, looking Cleion
           dead in the eye. "I offer you nothing but knowledge and wisdom far beyond that with
           which any human knows. I am the three evils, and I will chose the third, to tell you of all
           the evil the others have stolen from their perception.  </p>
