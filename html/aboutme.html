  <p class="textcenter"> Writing a novel about yourself isn't easy. Primarily this pertains to some general things about me.</p>
  <h3 class="textcenter"> A begining to an era... </h3>
  <hr class="style-five"></hr>
  <p class="textcenter"> I was born on September 19th, 1994 in New Braunfels, Texas. Though I was only born there by birth, I lived for most of my life (or at least my adolecent life) within a small town called Seguin. </p>
  <p class="textcenter">  From there I didn't really have a computer of my own until around first grade, for which I used a computer at a local library. I still recall the nostalgia of being able to utilize it and play video games on it. How simple life was then. </p>
  <p class="textcenter"> As I grew up, computers were no longer a casual occurance. I began to assimilate to a life style that revolved around them. I wanted to know how they worked, operated and most of all -- how to create and develop these games that are so enticing. Eventually that love grew and I aquired a computer of my own, installed various operating systems. Learned various programming aspects with websites and other languages. Created a silly game called "Link's adventure," for which only had option based turns where the user would pick through pure luck corridors within the lost woods(a certain area of Legend of Zelda: Orciana of Time). </p>
